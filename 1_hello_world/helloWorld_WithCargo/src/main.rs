// Rust is installed and managed by the rustup tool. It installs rustc,
//  cargo, rustdoc, rustup, and other standard tools to $HOME/.cargo/bin
//  on UNIX and %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin on Windows

// TOML : Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language
// cargo run : Compile the code using rustc complier
// Cargo clean : Clear the create files


//  Usually, cargo check is much faster than cargo build because it does not
//  produce an executable. It can be useful if you need to check the code multiple
//  times for compilability while writing the code
