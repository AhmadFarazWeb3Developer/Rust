fn main(){
   println!("Hello World!"); 
}

// we see the println!
// macro (! means it’s a Rust macro and not a normal function).



// rustc  filename.rs : compiles the rust code , rustc is rust compiler
// .\main.exe : Printing output



// Note : In code we are using no build tools which handling become mire complicated as the 
// program gets complex, so then the cargo came into real working

//  cargo is Rust’s package manager and build system. It handles the building of
//  your code and its dependencies.
